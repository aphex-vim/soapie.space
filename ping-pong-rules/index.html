                <h2>ping pong</h2>
                <p>The spring semester of 2021, Tony, Ory, and I made it a tradition to play ping pong after lunch 2-3 times a week. These are the rules that we decided on as a group</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>win condition</h2>
                <p>A winning score has two conditions:</p>
                <ul>  
                    <li>it must be greater than or equal to 11</li>
                    <li>it must be at least 2 points greater than the opponent's score</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>serving</h2>
                <p>The game starts with the first serve, you can alternate who serves first but it doesn't matter much. Every two points, the server changes. To serve, you drop/toss the ball and hit it onto your side of the table such that it passes over the net and hits your opponent's side. There is no limitation on how far you are from the table as long as the ball hits your side of the table, and then the opponent's. This means if you are really funny you can serve from across the room as a joke.</p>
                <p>When a serve hits the net and lands on the opponent's side, it can be called as a "let" which voids the serve. In the case of a let, the server just gets to attempt to serve the ball again.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>scoring</h2>
                <p>Only one point can be scored at a time. A point is awarded to a player when their opponent fails to "return" the ball. When the ball comes over the net and hits your side, it is ready to be returned. Returning the ball is as simple as hitting it such that it goes over the net and bounces off your opponent's side of the table. Given these rules, here are some common cases where you would be awarded a point:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your opponent attempts to return the ball, but it hits the net and stops on their side</li>
                    <li>Your opponent attempts to return the ball, but upon going over the net it does not hit your side of the table.</li>
                    <li>You return the ball and it bounces two times on the your opponent's side.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>additional rules</h2>
                <p>These are some more rules that we have decided needed recognition</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the ball hits the ceiling at any point, it is considered a failure to return, even if it bounces onto the opposing side.</li>
                    <li>If the ball hits the net at any height, and then rolls up the net and lands on the opposing side without touching your own side,it is considered a valid return.</li>
                    <li>If the ball hits the edge of the table, but bounces downwards toward the floor, it is still considered a valid return</li>
                    <li>For a player's first game of the day, they are entitled to a number of practice rallies to warm up</li>
                    <li>Re-serves are only allowed at the discretion of the non-server, no matter how embarrassing the serve was</li>
                    <li>absolutely <strong>NO</strong> references to popular nintendo character Wario</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>funny strokes</h2>
                <p>Listed below are some stokes we find funny, and decided to name.</p>
                <h3>clown spike</h3>
                <p>This is one of the first strokes that we classified. Contrary to its name, a clown spike is more of a drive than a spike. A clown spike occurs when a player attempts to return a high bouncing ball with a drive, but slams it into the net at a high speed. At the extreme, a clown-spiker will hit the ball so hard that it actually goes under the net, which can be confusing to score if the clown spike wasn't caught.</p>
                <h3>knuckle ballllllllll</h3>
                <p>A pretty common mistake for beginners, a knuckle ball is exactly what it sounds like. A knuckle ball is when the you hit the ball with your fingers instead of the racket. Although not impossible to return with, a knuckle ball generally leads to you losing a point. It is a somewhat common excuse for failure to return. If the opponent claims that the point was lost to a knuckle ball, the canned response is to say <i>"knuckle balllll"</i> in an annoying voice.</p>
