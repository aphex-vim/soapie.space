                <img src="../images/keyboard0.jpg" title="My first custom mechanical keyboard." alt="A keyboard roughly 75% the normal size of a keyboard, sitting on a desk. It has a band of light emanating from the bottom.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard1.jpg" title="A case missing a keyboard" alt="An empty keyboard case, it is blue anodized aluminum.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard2.jpg" title="The skeleton of a keyboard" alt="A printed circuit board sitting on a desk. It has small plastic and wire components installed, called 'stabilizers.'">
                <img src="../images/keyboard3.jpg" title="Closeup of a stabilizer" alt="A closeup picture of a stabilizer snapped into a PCB, lube can be seen on the wire.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard4.jpg" title="It is starting to look like a keyboard" alt="A partially assembled keyboard, sitting on a desk. The circuit board and switches are completely exposed, and it has no case.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard5.jpg" title="Rate my solder joints" alt="A closeup of  the PCB, after all the switches have been soldered into place.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard6.jpg" title="Getting ready to solder" alt="The PCB set in front of a soldering kit, ready to be soldered.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard7.jpg" title="A terrible picture" alt="An attempt at an artsy shot of the PCB because it looked pretty. It is black with gold contacts, and has nice contrast. The picture is ruined by a finger that can be seen in the top right of the frame.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard8.jpg" title="Like a glove" alt="The assembled board, fit snugly into the case. The switches are still exposed.">

                <img src="../images/keyboard10.jpg" title="A half naked keyboard" alt="The keyboard, but half of the key-caps haven't been installed, so the stems are still exposed.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard11.jpg" title="An artsy closeup" alt="A shot of the keyboard from the side, the camera is really close and captures nice details such as the texture of the key-caps and aluminum case.">
                <img src="../images/keyboard12.jpg" title="A nice overhead shot" alt="A shot of the keyboard from above and to the side, the camera is only in focus for the left portion of the keyboard, giving it a nice depth of field effect.">
