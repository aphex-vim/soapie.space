## making a low poly portrait of Shel Silverstein
The final project for my _Software for Design_ class was all about making illustrations for Shel Silverstein poems. He is the author of popular childrens' books such as _The Giving Tree_, _Where the Sidewalk Ends_, or _Falling up_. The whole class collaborated on making a book of illustrations for his poems. The portrait I made was part of the project that I submitted as both a promotional poster, and a possible cover for the book.

![Three book covers. First, the cover of the book 'Falling Up.' The cover features a kid flying up into the sky away from a city skyline. Next, the over of the book 'Where the Sidewalk Ends.' The cover features a couple of children looking over a sheer cliff, where a sidewalk ends. Last, the cover of the book 'The Giving Tree.' The cover features a tree dropping an apple into a child's hands.](/assets/shel0.webp "Falling Up, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and The Giving Tree")

## choosing a good image of Shel
I started this project by selecting a nice picture of Shel Silverstein. This part was pretty easy because he was very photogenic. I ended up going with this image, because I liked the slight tilt of his head and he has put on a big smile.

## starting to section off each part of Shel's face
I started making the low poly version of Shel by stitching together lines on a new layer in Adobe Illustrator. I had some rules about how many triangles could share a certain point to keep a little bit of order in how they were placed. I made use of direct select to select multiple lines end points at a time and shift them around to sculpt the face.

## filling in the "colors"
I wanted to keep my portrait in black and white, just as the image was. I started by copying my "triangles" layer into a separate one, and posing the frame as I wanted the finished portrait to be posed. I ended up tilting his head a bit more to exaggerate that part of the original image since I liked it so much. I then made all the lines have a weight of 0, so the edges didn't show up at all. Then I just used the eye-dropper tool to randomly decide what color each triangle was. Ideally the triangles would be the average color of the pixels inside them but I didn't care much if it was exact, so I just did it by hand and adjusted it as needed.

## the final product
I think I ended up with a really nice poster in the end. I really hope to make more portraits in this style and improve my techniques. I also would be interesting in scripting some of the process, like the coloring of the triangles, which would make producing art like this much easier.
