## about
I recently joined a dnd campaign with some friends, and one of the party members made friendship bracelets in the color palettes of our characters ([here's mine!](/assets/friendshipbracelet.jpeg)). 

I thought it would be fun to make our characters' color palettes into pride flags and had the idea to make a javascript webtoy to do it. After a couple days of work, this is what I ended up with!

## resources
- [jscolor.js](https://jscolor.com/) for color picking
- [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) for reorderable drag-and-drop lists
