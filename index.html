            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name's not actually speen, that's just a funny nickname. Feel free to call me Spencer/Spence. I'm a student studying computer science and graphic design at Marietta College, in Ohio. I love making things digitally, both art and software (although I hope to improve my ability to make things in the physical world this year). See some of my projects below!</p>
