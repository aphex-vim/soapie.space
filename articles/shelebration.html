                <h2>Making a low poly portrait of Shel Silverstein</h2>
                <p>The final project for my <i>Software for Design</i> class was all about making illustrations for Shel Silverstien poems. He is the author of popular childrens' books such as <i>The Giving Tree</i>, <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i>, or <i>Falling up</i>. The whole class collaborated on making a book of illustrations for his poems. The portrait I made was part of the project that I submitted as both a promotional poster, and a possible cover for the book.</p>
                <div class="flex-container">
                  <div><img src="../images/shel0.jpg" title="Falling Up" alt="Cover of the book 'Falling Up.'' The cover features a kid flying up into the sky away from a city skyline."></div>
                  <div><img src="../images/shel1.jpg" title="Where the Sidewalk Ends" alt="Cover of the book 'Where the Sidewalk Ends.' The cover features a couple of children looking over a sheer cliff, where a sidewalk ends."></div>
                  <div><img src="../images/shel2.jpg" title="The Giving Tree" alt="Cover of the book 'The Giving Tree.' The cover features a tree dropping an apple into a child's hands."></div>

                <h2>Choosing a good image of Shel</h2>
                <p>I started this project by selecting a nice picture of Shel Silverstein. This part was pretty easy because he was very photogenic. I ended up going with this image, becuase I liked the slight tilt of his head and he has put on a big smile.</p>
                <img src="../images/shel3.jpg" title="Shel Silverstien" alt="A black and white picture of Shel Silverstein. He has a bald head with thick eyebrows and a bushy beard.">
                <h2>Starting to section off each part of Shel's face</h2>
                <p>I started making the low poly version of Shel by stitching together lines on a new layer in Adobe Illustrator. I had some rules about how many triangles could share a certain point to keep a little bit of order in how they were placed. I made use of direct select to select multiple lines end points at a time and shift them around to sculpt the face.</p>
                <img src="../images/shel4.png" title="Wireframe of Shel's Face" alt="A work-in-progress picture of the Shel portrait. He has magenta lines covering his face in order use triangles to define the shape of his face.">
                <h2>Filling in the "colors"</h2>
                <p>I wanted to keep my portrait in black and white, just as the image was. I started by copying my "triangles" layer into a separate one, and posing the frame as I wanted the finished portrait to be posed. I ended up tilting his head a bit more to exaggerate that part of the original image since I liked it so much. I then made all the lines have a weight of 0, so the edges didn't show up at all. Then I just used the eye-dropper tool to randomly decide what color each triangle was. Ideally the triangles would be the average color of the pixels inside them but I didn't care much if it was exact, so I just did it by hand and adjusted it as needed.</p>
                <h2>The final product</h2>
                <p>I think I ended up with a really nice poster in the end. I really hope to make more portraits in this style and improve my techniques. I also would be interesting in scripting some of the process, like the coloring of the triangles, which would make producing art like this much easier.</p>

                <p>Viv just pointed out that I spelled software wrong. I am too lazy to fix this. Sorry.</p>
